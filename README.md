# Electoral overflows

A model for explaining voter overflows between first and second rounds of 2019 Presidential elections in Ukraine.
Electoral data scrapped from Ukrainian Central Electoral Comission website (https://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vp2019/wp001.html)

The results were published online on the VoxUkraine (https://voxukraine.org/uk/proval-mobilizatsiyi-yak-poroshenko-iz-triskom-prograv-zelenskomu/)

Anatolii Bondarenko built a more elaborate Bayesian model of overflows based on the same data. His publication is available here: http://texty.org.ua/pg/article/devrand/read/93486/Hto_zh_vsetaky_golosuvav_za_Zelenskogo_Najbilshe
